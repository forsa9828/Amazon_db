  What I build & why
  
Created a MySQL database that connects to the node application. This will display all items available for sale, including additional data about the products like price, name ect. It will prompt you to enter the id of the product and how many units you want. The application will then check to see if the store has enough of the product to met the customers request. If not, it will alert you that there is an insufficient quanity. If the product is available the application will update the SQL database to show the remaining quanity and display customer total cost.
